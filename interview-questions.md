# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: The paramater is the what you are inputing the argument is the actual value in the function. 

Researched answer: Parameters refers to the list of variables in a method declaration. Arguments are the actual values that are passed in when the method is invoked. When you invoke a method, the arguments used must match the declaration's parameters in type and order.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: The built in paramater which function the method is going to apply to. 

Researched answer: The function paramater is required. The currentValue parameter is optional, arr is optional, index is optional, thisValue is optional. 

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: Map is going to go through each position in the array and it will return an array that is the same lenght as the array it went through.

Researched answer: While both the .filter() and .map() methods will return a new array, .filter() will create a new array of array elements that pass a given test while .map() will create a new array made up of the results of calling a function on each array element.



1. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is each position inside of the array.

Researched answer: The iteration is used for loops when we want to repeat something easily. Its bascilly the loop part of the code. We tell it when to start, when to finish, and which way to go, forward or backward. 
(var i = arr.length; i >=0; i++)

1. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: A function is a set of intstructions used for a task. A method is instructions but for an object. 

Researched answer: A function is a piece of code called by name. It takes an input and returns an output. A method is almost identical except it operates on the object it was called upon. 

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: When you move the declarations to the top of the page

Researched answer: Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Component: Components are reusable bits of code. They work like functions but return HTML

2. Spread operator: Its used when all the elements from an object need to be included. 
{ ...array }

3. React state: React components has a built-in state object.

The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.

4. React props: The type of object where the value of the attribute is stored. Works like HMTL attributes.

5. DOM events: it is a signal that something has occured or is occuring.
